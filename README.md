# Cluster Development

This is the main repo for everything related to the cluster development project. All persisting documentation and code will be stored in the main branch. Development for each semester will be done in a separate semester branch.

## Overview

A 4 member team that works with a Raspberry Pi cluster to investigate HPC-related cluster scheduling, networking and resource management.  

**Current Manager:** [Jaspar Martin](https://github.com/jasparm)

**Progress:**

- A cluster with four RPi 4 nodes was setup and connected to each other.

- SLURM controller and executor packages were installed and tested on the cluster.

- SLURM dashboard was installed and some serial benchmarking was done using it.

**Goals:**

- Complete goals set last semester â€“ automated Ansible-based node config, setup remote SSH and build hardware enclosure.

- Integrating Apache Spark with SLURM?

- Comparing different job scheduling algorithms?

- Build custom job scheduler?

- Install / setup load balanced web server?

**Skills Involved:**

- Linux (Bash) scripting

- Networking and server config.

- Low-level programming (C/C++)

- Parallel computing and distributed resource management

## Project

There is a GitHub project linked to this repo that will be used to track the progress of the project. This will be populated over time with the different tasks and deliverables that need to be completed. The project board is linked [here](https://github.com/orgs/MonashDeepNeuron/projects/6).

## Discussions

GitHub discussions will be used to communicate and store ideas, questions and other information related to the project. We will also use discussions to take meeting notes. The discussions page is linked [here](https://github.com/MonashDeepNeuron/ClusterDevelopment/discussions).
